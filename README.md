## Prerequisites

- Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

### Access Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ npm run develop
```
To test the CMS locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:
```
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```

## Debugging
Windows users might encounter ```node-gyp``` errors when trying to npm install.
To resolve, make sure that you have both Python 2.7 and the Visual C++ build environment installed.
```
npm config set python python2.7
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```
