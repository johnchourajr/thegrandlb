      "body": "I don’t normally post but after holding hosting 3 different events at The Grand I had to! The Grand has several great rooms and an outdoor courtyard, it’s the perfect space to hold events. It’s located right off the 405 freeway so it’s easy to get to. I have hosted both my mother and sons (21st) Birthday parties and mother-in-law’s anniversary there. Each time we had the best of service. The staff is amazingly polite and extremely attentive. The pricing is on point! You get quality food at a great value. They work with you on your menu to maximize your budget without feeling or looking like you took any shortcuts. The bartender service was great. Parking couldn’t be more convenient. They have their own parking structure and great driveway for having valet service. I’m sure I’ll be doing another event there!",

      "body": "We had our wedding in the outside room (Palm Courtyard). The venue was amazing and everything was set up just the way we wanted it. Marissa and Lauren were super helpful and on top of everything as we had an out of state wedding. All of our guests loved the food which was cooked perfectly. The Grand was able to customize the room layout, the food and drink package, and even accommodate vegetarian as well as vegan guests with no problems. Any issues we ran in to they were more than willing to help us resolve. Planning a wedding from two thousand miles away is tough, but the Grand made it so much easier for us.",
